# Emotion Recognition from Indian Classical Music using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Initiated and led the development of a custom data preprocessing pipeline for music data, achieving a 40% reduction in processing time and optimizing efficiency for deep learning applications.

Utilized Python programming to extract complex audio features using Librosa, successfully capturing 9 distinct emotional nuances in Indian classical music, demonstrating proficiency in feature engineering.

Designed and implemented a robust feature extraction method, including MFCC, chroma, mel-spectrogram, and other advanced audio features.

Collaborated with a team of five to design a hybrid model suite, integrating deep learning with traditional machine learning algorithms, resulting in a 50% reduction in code redundancy.

Achieved a remarkable 93.49% accuracy in emotion classification using a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, showcasing expertise in deploying effective deep learning models.

Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to optimize performance and accuracy.
